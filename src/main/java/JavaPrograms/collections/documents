* Collections is a framework provided by Java
* This framework provides many interfaces and their implemented classes in order to store group of Objects in a
  single entity
 * We have Collections class inside Collections framework


Vectors:
 * Vector will increase its size by 100% of its size
 * Default capacity of Vector is 10
 * What is the initial capacity of vector 10
 * Does it allows duplicate elements : Yes
 * Does it allow null values: Yes
 * Does it maintain insertion order: Yes
 * Does it maintain sorted order : No
 * Does it offer random access of elements : Yes
 * Is vector synchronized : Yes (It does not allow multi threading)
 * What is it good at? When we have multiple thread implementation and When data is increased exponentially.


 Lists:
 * Array list will increase its size by 50% of its size
 * Vector will increase its size by 100% of its size
    * Default capacity of List is 0
    * What is the initial capacity of List 10
    * Does it allows duplicate elements : Yes
    * Does it allow null values: Yes
    * Does it maintain insertion order: Yes
    * Does it maintain sorted order : No
    * Does it offer random access of elements : Yes
    * Is vector synchronized : No (But by using Collections class we can synchronize the list)
    * What is it good at? When data is not increased exponentially.
