Class : Class is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.
Object : A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity,
        a behavior and a state. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables),
        while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

OOPS: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.
